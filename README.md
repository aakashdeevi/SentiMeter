## Technical Implementation

### Sentiment Analysis Engine
- Uses **VADER** from NLTK library
- Rule-based model specifically attuned to social media/textual sentiments
- Scores text based on:
  - **Positive** (pos): 0.0 to 1.0
  - **Negative** (neg): 0.0 to 1.0
  - **Neutral** (neu): 0.0 to 1.0
  - **Compound**: Normalized score between -1 (most negative) and +1 (most positive)

### Classification Logic
- **Positive**: compound score ≥ 0.05
- **Negative**: compound score ≤ -0.05
- **Neutral**: -0.05 < compound score < 0.05

## CSV File Format

For bulk sentiment analysis, prepare a CSV file with **at least one column named `content`**. Example format:

```csv
id,content,source
1,"I love this product! It's amazing.","Twitter"
2,"The service was terrible and slow.","Feedback form"
3,"It's okay, nothing special.","Survey"
```

- The app will process each row and return the original data augmented with **sentiment scores** (`Positive`, `Negative`, `Neutral`, `Compound`).
